## Description

If you've ever misplaced something (which you almost certainly have), you understand the frustration of being sure you have something, but not being able to find it. You're left to either waste time searching, or to purchase a new item. Home Index is designed to elimate this problem by helping you keep track of all of your posessions. Whether you're a maker wanting  to organize a workshop, a parent interested in keepig track household supplies, or a teacher looking to make sure materials end up back where they started, Home Index is an extremely valuable asset.

Home Index is an inventory management unlike nearly all others. It follows a simple, 3 part hierarchy system. Items are sorted into "containers", which are sorted into "spaces", which are sorted into "locations". For example, you might have bandaids, placed in a first aid kit, placed in the trunk, inside your car. Similarly, you might have a charging cable, in the top drawer, in your bedroom, in your home. This simple sorting structure makes it quick to sort your items, while still making them extremely easy to find later. It's difficult to fully appreciate the magic of Home Index until you need to find something you remember seeing, but can't find. Regardless of whether you index 100 items, or 10000 items, Home Index makes finding what you need a matter of seconds, rather than hours.


## Features

### Simple

Home Index's simplicity makes it even more powerful for its intended use case. When you're sorting your house, you don't want to have to worry about serial numbers, product IDs, and other business-oriented information. As such, items are only required to have a name. All additional information is entirely optional.

### Efficient

Home Index is extremely lightweight, and doesn't depend on JavaScript or other intensive web technologies. This means it will be able to keep up with you, no matter how many belongings you index.

### Modern

Despite its lightweight nature, Home Index looks modern and organized. It'll fit right in with the rest of your applications, and works great on both mobile and desktop screens.

### Self Hosted

Home Index can be completely self hosted, and has absolutely no external dependencies. It doesn't even need an internet connection to function, just as long as you can connect to your host!

### Private

Home Index is completely private, and contains absolutely zero trackers of any kind. Your information is only accessible to the people you explicitly grant access to.

### Configurable

Home Index is extremely configurable, and uses a web front-end to make configuration as easy as possible. Administrators can update their Home Index instance's settings from anywhere.

### Searchable

Home Index comes with a search tool to make locating lost items quick and easy. Just enter in a short search phrase, and Home Index will search the entire database in a fraction of a second.

### Reliable

It's common for Home Index users to log hundreds, if not thousands of items. As such, it's critical that this information is protected, so Home Index comes with built in backup tools.

### Themes

Home Index comes with several built in themes to fit your style. The dark theme provides a sleek look, while the light theme is more visible in bright light. The rainbow theme gives a playful impression while the contrast theme makes the interface more accesible.

### Fast

Home Index uses reasonable shortcuts to make adding and manipulating items as fast as possible. Form values that are likely to be reused will presist between submissions, reducing the time required to enter each item while indexing items.

### Portable

Home Index uses a portable database format that can be copied and transferred between separate instances with minimal steps. There's even a built in tool to dump the contents of the database in a format that can be read by other Home Index instances.

### Secure

Home Index uses sanitization features to protect its integrity and stability. If malformed or malicious information is submitted through any forms, Home Index will try to filter it out before processing it.
