# Home Index

A quick and easy way to sort your possessions.


## Description

Home Index is an inventory management system designed around organizing your personal possessions, rather than business assets. It follows a simple, 3 part hierarchy system. Items are sorted into "containers", which are sorted into "spaces", which are sorted into "locations". For example, you might have bandaids, placed in a first aid kit, placed in the trunk, inside your car. Similarly, you might have a charging cable, in the top drawer, in your bedroom, in your home. This simple sorting structure makes it quick to sort your items, while still making them extremely easy to find later.


## Features

When you're sorting your house, you don't want to have to worry about serial numbers, product IDs, and other information, like you would with a business. Home Index is designed for personal use, and makes it as simple as possible to organize your possessions.
